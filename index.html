		<p class="music-lyrics">
			I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down <br />
			I need your loving, loving <br />
			I need it now <br />
			When I'm without you, I'm something weak <br />
			You got me begging, begging <br />
			I'm on my knees <br />
			<br />
			I don't wanna be needing your love <br />
			I just wanna be deep in your love <br />
			And it's killing me when you're away <br />
			Ooh, baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are <br />
			I just wanna be there where you are <br />
			And I gotta get one little taste <br />
			<br />
			Sugar, yes, please <br />
			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			I'm right here, 'cause I need <br />
			Little love and little sympathy <br />
			Yeah, you show me good loving <br />
			Make it alright <br />
			Need a little sweetness in my life <br />
			Sugar, yes, please <br />
			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			<br />
			My broken pieces, you pick them up <br />
			Don't leave me hanging, hanging <br />
			Come give me some <br />
			When I'm without ya, I'm so insecure <br />
			You are the one thing, one thing <br />
			I'm living for <br />
			I don't wanna be needing your love <br />
			I just wanna be deep in your love <br />
			And it's killing me when you're away <br />
			Ooh, baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are <br />
			I just wanna be there where you are <br />
			And I gotta get one little taste <br />
			<br />
			Sugar, yes, please <br />
			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			I'm right here, 'cause I need <br />
			Little love and little sympathy <br />
			Yeah, you show me good loving <br />
			Make it alright <br />
			Need a little sweetness in my life <br />
			Sugar, yes, please <br />
			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			<br />
			Yeah <br />
			I want that red velvet <br />
			I want that sugar sweet <br />
			Don't let nobody touch it <br />
			Unless that somebody's me <br />
			I gotta be a man <br />
			There ain't no other way <br />
			'Cause, girl, you're hotter than <br />
			The southern California bay <br />
			I don't wanna play no games <br />
			I don't gotta be afraid <br />
			Don't give all that shy shit <br />
			No make up on, that's my <br />
			Sugar, yes, please <br />
			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			I'm right here, 'cause I need <br />
			Little love and little sympathy <br />
			Yeah, baby, you show me good loving <br />
			Make it alright <br />
			Need a little sweetness in my life <br />
			Sugar, yes, please <br />
			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			<br />
			Sugar, yes, please <br />
			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			I'm right here, 'cause I need <br />

			Won't you come and put it down on me? <br />
			Down on me, down on me, ooh
